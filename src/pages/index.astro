            Hey there, welcome to my personal site. I go by both EFIcats and
            ext4cats online, but you can call me Alex. I do computer wizardry
            for a living, and mostly play videogames during my time off.
          </p>
          <p class="paragraph">
            Professionally, I handle backend development, deployment, and
            sporadic infrastructure maintenance roles. On my free time, I also
            dabble in web design for my own projects.
          </p>
          <p class="paragraph">
            farmarrays.com is where I host all of my personal projects â€”
            alongside my personal e-mail, and my Bluesky handle. You can find
            all of my socials below.

            <dt>TypeScript / JavaScript</dt>
            <dd>
              My main highlight, and what I use every day at work. I know the
              ins and outs of the type system well, and can handle setting up
              all of the necessary tooling to manage TS/JS projects. I use <em
                >NestJS</em
              > for backend work and <em>React</em> for frontend work, with <em
                >PNPM</em
              > as my package manager of choice.
            </dd>
            <dt>Docker</dt>
            <dd>
              My closest friend; both when setting up local environments and
              production deployments. I can handle writing complex multi-stage
              Dockerfiles to build applications of any size and shape, and tie
              it all together with docker-compose.
            </dd>
            <dt>Linux</dt>
            <dd>
              My operating system of choice for development workloads. I have no
              issues with performing basic system maintenance, writing basic
              shell scripts, and general usage of the command line.
            </dd>
            <dt>PostgreSQL</dt>
            <dd>
              My database of choice, but I can also handle other dialects. I can
              design database schemas and write complex queries to suit my
              needs.
            </dd>
            <dt>Proxmox / QEMU / libvirt / Baremetal deployment</dt>
            <dd>
              I can manage setup and maintenance of virtual machines, with all
              the necessary virtual hardware configurations. I can set up both
              Linux and Windows based systems.
